# Order Prioritization System Using Algorithms

## Overview
The **Order Prioritization System (OPS)** is designed to streamline order processing by leveraging algorithms to assign priority levels dynamically. By analyzing order urgency, inventory status, and historical data, the system ensures efficient order fulfillment and resource optimization.

## Features
- Uses **priority scheduling algorithms** to manage order execution.
- Implements **real-time order processing** for dynamic prioritization.
- Employs **machine learning techniques** for intelligent decision-making.
- Enhances **operational efficiency** by reducing manual intervention.
- Supports **scalability** for businesses with varying order volumes.

## Prerequisites
- **Operating System:** Any OS with internet access.
- **Programming Language:** C.
- **Compiler:** A C compiler (GCC recommended).
- **Development Environment:** Any IDE supporting C (e.g., CodeBlocks, VS Code).
- **Optional:** Database management system for extended functionality (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-repo/order-prioritization-system.git
  ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
  cd order-prioritization-system
  ```
3. Compile the code:
  ```bash
  gcc order_prioritization.c -o ops
  ```
4. Run the program:
  ```bash
  ./ops
  ```

## Usage
- Enter the details for incoming orders (dish name and cooking time).
- The system will automatically prioritize orders based on cooking time.
- Orders will be processed sequentially, minimizing delays.
- The output displays the order queue and execution sequence.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of machine learning models for smarter decision-making.
- Real-time data analytics for better insights.
- Implementation of cloud-based order management for scalability.
- Mobile application integration for remote order monitoring.
